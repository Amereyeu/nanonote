Welcome to Nanonote!

Nanonote is a minimalist note taking application.

It's meant for short-lived notes. Any text you type here is automatically saved (in $NOTE_PATH).

The only UI is the context menu, try it out!

As you can see in the context menu, Nanonote has an "Always on Top" mode. This feature is handy to keep the window around.

It also has a few handy editing features, like auto-bullet lists:

- Try to move the cursor at the end of this line and press Enter
- This works for
    - nested lists
    * and asterisks

It also makes any http url like this clickable: https://github.com/agateau/nanonote

Finally, you can indent/unindent text by selecting it and pressing Tab and Shift+Tab.

That's all there is to say, now you can erase this text and start taking notes!
