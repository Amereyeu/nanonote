This directory stores code coming from third-parties. They are integrated as git submodules.

- Catch2: https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2
- qpropgen: https://github.com/agateau/qpropgen
- singleapplication/src: https://github.com/itay-grudev/SingleApplication. The submodule is in an `src` subdirectory so that we can define a real CMake target in `singleapplication/CMakeLists.txt`.
